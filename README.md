# Project 1 - Airline Customers Satisfaction      
 # Objectives           
 # The main aim of this analysis is to assess various machine learning algorithms and determine the most suitable algorithm to classify customer satisfaction. This analysis also aims to ascertain and highlight the most critical variables in determining customer satisfaction.
 
 # Steps Involved in the Analysis        
 # 1.Loading the Dataset                 
 # 2.Data Cleaning       
 # 3.Data Preprocessing
 # 4.Model Selection i.e Random Forest,Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machine,K-Nearest Neighbors         
 # 5.Model Comparison    
   **Random Forest gave the highest Accuracy of 96%.**    
   # Questions    
  **1.Find  the Number of customers based on satisfaction using a countplot.**            
   **2.Find the Customer satisfaction based on class of travel.**     

   Answers      
  **1.From the analysis from countplot,a total of 56428 customers were satisfied while 73452 Customers were disatisfied meaning that**
  **measures should be put in place to enhance more Customer Satisfaction.**           
   **2.A total number 45000 Customers were satisfied in the business class,12000 for Economy and less than 10000 Customers for economy plus**
 
# Project 2-Ensemble Machine Learning Project on SocialNetworks ads Dataset
# Project Overview
# The main objective of this project is to use Ensemble Machine Learning Model i.e Bagging and Boosting to predict the accuracy of the Socialnetworks ads Dataset and also to find the statistics of Social Networks attacks based on the following;             
1.Find the percentage of Benign and Malicious Requests.          
2.Retrieve the number of Requests from different Protocols i.e CMP,UDP,TCP                
3.Mlicious Attacks from different IP Addresses                
4.Malicious Attacks from different protocols              
5.Find the number of request               
6.Find the number of Attacks requests.              
.The dataset was downloaded from  kaggle   https://www.kaggle.com/code/emansalah2000/socialnetworkads    

# Highlights from the Analysis  
Percentage of Benign requests-39.1%             
Percentage of Malicious request-60.9%              

UDP Protol-17499     
CMP(Malicious)-9419                            
TCP-13866    

# Project 3-Used Bike Price Prediction
# About The Project 
# In This Project , The Price Of THe Second Hand Used Bikes is predicted on the Basis Of Kms Driven, Brand, Etc. We Using Linear Regresiion Model, Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression Model Of Machine Learning ..



# So Here Randomforest Regressor model is more accurate than linear Regression,Decision tree regressor model
