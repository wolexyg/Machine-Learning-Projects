# Machine Learning Projects
# Project 1 - Airline Customers Satisfaction      
 # Objectives           
 # The main aim of this analysis is to assess various machine learning algorithms and determine the most suitable algorithm to classify customer satisfaction. This analysis also aims to ascertain and highlight the most critical variables in determining customer satisfaction.
 
 # Steps Involved in the Analysis        
 # 1.Loading the Dataset                 
 # 2.Data Cleaning       
 # 3.Data Preprocessing
 # 4.Model Selection i.e Random Forest,Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machine,K-Nearest Neighbors         
 # 5.Model Comparison    
   **Random Forest gave the highest Accuracy of 96%.**    
   # Questions    
  **1.Find  the Number of customers based on satisfaction using a countplot.**            
   **2.Find the Customer satisfaction based on class of travel.**     

   Answers      
  **1.From the analysis from countplot,a total of 56428 customers were satisfied while 73452 Customers were disatisfied meaning that**
  **measures should be put in place to enhance more Customer Satisfaction.**           
   **2.A total number 45000 Customers were satisfied in the business class,12000 for Economy and less than 10000 Customers for economy plus**

# Project 2-Ensemble Machine Learning Project on SocialNetworks ads Dataset
# Project Overview
# The main objective of this project is to use Ensemble Machine Learning Model i.e Bagging and Boosting to predict the accuracy of the Socialnetworks ads Dataset and also to find the statistics of Social Networks attacks based on the following;             
1.Find the percentage of Benign and Malicious Requests.          
2.Retrieve the number of Requests from different Protocols i.e CMP,UDP,TCP                
3.Mlicious Attacks from different IP Addresses                
4.Malicious Attacks from different protocols              
5.Find the number of request               
6.Find the number of Attacks requests.              
.The dataset was downloaded from  kaggle   https://www.kaggle.com/code/emansalah2000/socialnetworkads    

# Highlights from the Analysis  
Percentage of Benign requests-39.1%             
Percentage of Malicious request-60.9%              

UDP Protol-17499     
CMP(Malicious)-9419                            
TCP-13866    

# Project 3-Used Bike Price Prediction
# About The Project 
# In This Project , The Price Of THe Second Hand Used Bikes is predicted on the Basis Of Kms Driven, Brand, Etc. We Using Linear Regresiion Model, Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression Model Of Machine Learning ..



# So Here Randomforest Regressor model is more accurate than linear Regression,Decision tree regressor model

# Project 4-Machine Learning in Agriculture Project

This is dataset which is used to recommend the crop for the suitable soil. This will be very useful in crop production (Agriculture) **without looses based on soli ph, rainfall, humadity and other chemical components present in the soil.

# About the data                  
Nitrogen is so vital because it is a major component of chlorophyll, the compound by which plants use sunlight energy to produce sugars from water and carbon dioxide (i.e., photosynthesis). It is also a major component of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Without proteins, plants wither and die.              
Phosphorus is, therefore, important in cell division and development of new tissue. Phosphorus is also associated with complex energy transformations in the plant. Adding phosphorus to soil low in available phosphorus promotes root growth and winter hardiness, stimulates tillering, and often hastens maturity.                
Potassium is a critical nutrient that plants absorb from the soil, and from fertilizer. It increases disease resistance, helps stalks to grow upright and sturdy, improves drought tolerance, and helps plants get through the winter.             
The average soil temperatures for bioactivity range from 50 to 75F. These values are favorable for normal life functions of earth biota that ensure proper organic matter decomposition, increased nitrogen mineralization, uptake of soluble substances, and metabolism.
The pH range 5.5â€“6.5 is optimal for plant growth as the availability of nutrients is optimal.                   
Besides disease, rainfall can also determine how fast a crop will grow from seed, including when it will be ready for harvesting. A good balance of rain and proper irrigation can lead to faster-growing plants, which can cut down on germination time and the length between seeding and harvest.
