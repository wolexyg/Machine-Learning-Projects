 ### 2.Data Cleaning       
 ### 3.Data Preprocessing
 ### 4.Model Selection i.e Random Forest,Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machine,K-Nearest Neighbors         
 ### 5.Model Comparison    
   **Random Forest gave the highest Accuracy of 96%.**    
   ### Questions    
  -  Find  the Number of customers based on satisfaction using a countplot.           
  -  Find the Customer satisfaction based on class of travel.
  -              

   ## Answers      
  ###  1.From the analysis from countplot,a total of 56428 customers were satisfied while 73452 Customers were disatisfied meaning that measures should be put in place to enhance more Customer Satisfaction.

  ### 2.A total number 45000 Customers were satisfied in the business class,12000 for Economy and less than 10000 Customers for economy plus..

 ##  Insights from the Charts           
- People flying shorter distances are more likely to be dissatisfied than satisfied.          
- Increase in delay also increases the dissatisfaction levels.          
- Customers traveling in business class appear to be more satisfied than the customers traveling in economy or economy plus class.      
- Low satisfaction is associated with low in-flight entertainment, seat comfort, online boarding, and economy class.

# Project 4-Machine Learning in Agriculture Project   
## Project Overview           
## This dataset is used to recommend the crop for a suitable soil. This will be very useful in crop production (Agriculture) **without looses based on soli ph, rainfall, humadity and other chemical components present in the soil.

## About the data  (Exploratory Data Analysis)                  
Nitrogen is so vital because it is a major component of chlorophyll, the compound by which plants use sunlight energy to produce sugars from water and carbon dioxide (i.e., photosynthesis). It is also a major component of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Without proteins, plants wither and die.                    
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/kcfhp12/Nitrogen.jpg" alt="Nitrogen" border="0">        
Phosphorus is, therefore, important in cell division and development of new tissue. Phosphorus is also associated with complex energy transformations in the plant. Adding phosphorus to soil low in available phosphorus promotes root growth and winter hardiness, stimulates tillering, and often hastens maturity.

Potassium is a critical nutrient that plants absorb from the soil, and from fertilizer. It increases disease resistance, helps stalks to grow upright and sturdy, improves drought tolerance, and helps plants get through the winter.                      
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/fMcvCrm/Potassium.jpg" alt="Potassium" border="0">             
The average soil temperatures for bioactivity range from 50 to 75F. These values are favorable for normal life functions of earth biota that ensure proper organic matter decomposition, increased nitrogen mineralization, uptake of soluble substances, and metabolism.   
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/mS16S8Y/Temperature.jpg" alt="Temperature" border="0">             
The pH range 5.5–6.5 is optimal for plant growth as the availability of nutrients is optimal.

Besides disease, rainfall can also determine how fast a crop will grow from seed, including when it will be ready for harvesting. A good balance of rain and proper irrigation can lead to faster-growing plants, which can cut down on germination time and the length between seeding and harvest.

# Project 5-Mall Customers Segmentation with K-Means Clustering     
## Project Overview             
You own the mall and want to understand the customers who can be easily converge
 Target Customers so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the 
strategy accordingly.         

# The Data            
For this project we will be using the Mall Customers dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset was created by Ehsanullah and Maryam Zekri, who constructed it in 2015. It is a synthetic dataset (i.e. not real-world data) based on a hypothetical scenario. It contains basic information on 200 fictional customers of a shopping centre. The dataset consists of 5 columns:     

- CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.       

- Gender: The gender of the customer.         

- Age: The age of the customer.             

- Annual Income (k$): The annual income of the customer (in thousands of dollars).         

- Spending Score (1–100): A score assigned to the customer based on their spending habits. The score ranges from 1 to 100, with a higher score indicating a customer who spends more.     



  ## The Business Task          
We will analyse the dataset primarily using K-means Clustering to see if we can segment the customers into different groups (clusters) who have common behaviours and characteristics. What we are looking for is a better understanding of the shopping centres customers. This information can then be used in marketing activity to segment their audiences more effectively and in a more targeted and relevant way. It could also be used in loyalty programmes and in improving the overall customer experience at the shopping centre.

## Cluster Segmentation of Customers

## Insights              
- There are 200 customers in the dataset.              
- The mean age of the customers is 39, with a standard deviation of 14. The youngest customer is 18 years old and the oldest is 70.      
- In terms of annual income, it ranges from 15k to 137k. The average income is 60k, with a standard deviation of 26k.           
- 25% of the customers are 29 years old or younger. The 75th percentile (Q3) is 49, indicating that 75% of the customers are younger than 49 years old.                                   
- There is a weak positive correlation (0.186) between Gender and Spending Score, indicating that female customers tend to have slightly higher spending scores than male customers.                            
- There is a weak negative correlation (-0.345) between Spending Score and Age, indicating that younger customers tend to have slightly higher spending scores.                    
- There is a weak positive correlation (0.02) between Annual Income and Age, indicating that older customers tend to have only very slightly higher incomes.      

## Conclusion and Recommendations            
It is worth remembering that k-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique, which means it doesn’t use labeled data to make predictions. Instead, it identifies patterns in the data based on similarity. As discussed it would be recommended to a do a lot of further research on their customers to make more informed business decision
